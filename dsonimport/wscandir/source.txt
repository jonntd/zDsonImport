Built for Windows from https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir v1.2.  Building this is annoying:

- Python modules only build with VC2013, not 2015.
- Install Python 2.7 for Windows.
- Run SET VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS120COMNTOOLS% to work around "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat".
- "C:\Program Files\Python27\python.exe" setup.py build

On other OS's where this isn't built it'll use the fallback.  This optimization is mostly
important on Windows, so that's OK.


This is renamed to "wscandir" to avoid confusion with any scandir installed by the system.
